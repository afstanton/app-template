# app-template

This is my basic shell for creating new apps. I keep finding new gems and other tools that are really useful for apps, but I often forget about them. It's also tedious to go through proper setup for each of these every single time I create something new, so if I get it right here, it's all good.

Feel free to use this and/or to make suggestions for improvement.

Cheers!
